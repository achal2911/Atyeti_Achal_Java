 Bank Account Tracker with Static & Instance Variables
Create a BankAccount class that tracks:

static int totalAccounts â€“ Total number of accounts created (shared across all)

final int accountId â€“ Unique per account, assigned in constructor

double balance â€“ Instance variable

Task:
Create 5 accounts and deposit varying amounts.

Ensure account IDs are unique using static counter.

Print totalAccounts after all accounts are created.

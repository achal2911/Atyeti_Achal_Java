Problem 4: Temperature Converter with Typecasting and Variable Overflows
📝 Requirements:
Build a TemperatureConverter class with methods to:
Convert Celsius ↔ Fahrenheit ↔ Kelvin.
Use:
float for input values
byte or short for testing overflow scenarios (e.g., store a converted value into a byte and show overflow behavior)
Example:
Convert 1000°C to byte and display before/after casting
Include:
Manual casting and automatic type promotion
Print internal variable values to explain overflow
🧠 Concepts Covered:
Primitive types and memory limits
Overflow demonstration
Manual and implicit typecasting
Arithmetic on different types
